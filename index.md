# Getting started tutorial

You can add, manage, and delete SSH keys by using the SSH Keys page. Access to the SSH Keys screen is permission-based. Some users cannot access or interact with this screen. If you need access and do not have it, contact your account administrator.

Follow these steps to get started by accessing the SSH Keys screen.
1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Devices > Manage > SSH Keys** from the Navigation Bar to access the SSH keys screen.

## Next Steps

After you access the SSH keys screen, you can [add SSH keys](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys/add-ssh-key.html), [edit labels and notes](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys/edit-details-ssh-key.html), and [remove SSH keys](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys/remove-ssh-key.html). No more than 100 SSH keys can be associated with an account at any time.
