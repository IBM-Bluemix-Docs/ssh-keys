# Editing details for an SSH key

After [adding an SSH key](add-ssh-key.html) in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}, you can edit the key details. You can edit the **Label** (the short name that is used to easily identify the SSH key) and the **Notes** for the key.

If you need to edit the key itself, remove the key and add the correct key to the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. The fingerprint that is listed with the details for the SSH key is not the key itself - it is a short sequence of bytes used in the retrieval of the key. The fingerprint might not represent the actual SSH key in any way. 

Follow these steps to edit SSH key details:

1. Access the **SSH Keys** screen in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window}.
2. Click anywhere in the **Label** field or the **Notes** field to open the field for edits.
3. Type the updated text in the corresponding field.
4. Click anywhere on the screen to close the field to more edits.


## Next Steps

SSH key details that are edited are updated immediately in the SSH keys list.
